# Description

This repository contains the files and data necessary to replicate the analyses described in the following paper:

[*A reassessment of the impact of temperature change on
European conflict during the second millennium CE using a bespoke
Bayesian time-series model
*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-021-03022-2)

In this study, we re-evaluated previously published results regarding the impact of long-term temperature change on conflict in Europe during the 2nd millennium CE. In that previous study, the authors identified a negative relationship between temperature and 2snd millennium European conflict levels (see the study [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9659-2)). Those results were based on a statistical model that wasn't optimal given the data at hand, however. So, we developed a new Bayesian time-series (state-space) model that better accounts for the nature and structure of the historical conflict record. Our findings indicate that there was no long-term relationship between changing temperatures and conflict levels.

# Replication
To replicate the analysis described in the paper, start an R session with the working directory set to `./Src` in this repository. Then, sun `source("start.R")`. Assuming you have the required libraries installed, the scripts will build the appropriate model and run the MCMC using Nimble. To produce plots, uncomment the plot commands in `./Src/NimblePoisTS_change.R` and/or explore the plotting scripts in the `./Src/Plotting/` folder.
